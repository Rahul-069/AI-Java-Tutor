## 🚀 Getting Started

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.8+
Gradio
Torch with CUDA (recommended for GPU acceleration)
transformers
accelerate

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-Java-Tutor.git
cd AI-Java-Tutor

2️⃣ Install dependencies
Run this in your Python environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the app
python javaaitutor.py

Note: If running on Google Colab, open the notebook version, change the runtime to T4 GPU and run all cells — a public Gradio link will be generated automatically.
